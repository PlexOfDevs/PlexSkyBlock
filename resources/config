# You can set the SkyBlock world that the plugin will use in your server by changing this variable.

# The magic cobblestone generator is automatically enabled when you first start up the plugin.
# When enabled cobblestone generators will generate much more than just cobblestone.
# When disabled cobblestone generators will function normally.
# In the future, what the Magic cobblestone generator produces will be customizable.

# You can edit the below values to change what the magic cobblestone generator spawns.
# To edit/add just put a block id into the list. If you want a higher chance of an ore to
# then put it in the list more than one time.
# For example, here is the format for an ore generator that has a 1/5 chance of spawning diamond blocks.
# and a 4/5 chance of spawning cobblestone:
# MagicCobbleGenOres:
#  - 4
#  - 4
#  - 4
#  - 4
#  - 57
MagicCobbleGen Ores:
  - 4
  - 4

#The Starting Items are the items in SkyBlock that a player will recieve when they first generate their island.
#These items can be edited in the config here. It is really simple and follows this format: "id, damage, count"
#id is the item id for an item in Minecraft, for example: stone's id is 1
#damage is the data value which cooresponds with each individual id. For example: Red would have the id 35 and the damage 14
#count is pretty simple. It is the amount of each item that the player will recieve. It is NOT recommended to set this number super high.
